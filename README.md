I am using the git branch on my local ide, Visual Studio, to edit this file.
I am a 19 year old from Sonoma County, who is a 2nd year at a local JC. 
I like coding as i just enjoy tech in general. My favourite highschool
class was a java class that introduced to me how fun coding in a group can
really be.
